# Generics

Generics are used throughout the application to boilerplate as much reusable code as possible.

I've tried to use the same names for the generic types to make it easier to follow the code.

1. `TRecord` represents data records, such as a Weather Forecast.

`TKey` represents the primary key of the record, such as `WatherForecastId`.
